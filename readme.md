New stuff :)

**before june**
- qr factorization (da migliorare ancora) 
- houseolder vector 
- Approximate U
- Approximate V
- solver for counting residual error at each iterative step
- NEW optimal k function for compare our error with svd error

**october**
- thin qr factorization 
- Approximate U, Approximate V (new for thin qr)
- Solver 2 for graph plotting
